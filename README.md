# Tool: Microsoft Excel
The analysis of the dataset was done on Microsoft Excel using PivotTable.

# Data preparation and cleaning
* Copy and paste the data into another sheet.
* Checked for duplicate orders using Highlight Cells Rules in the Conditional Formatting feature on the OrderID column and CustomerID Column.
* Check for completeness and uniformity of the data items using the filter feature.
* A new column was created: Year, derived from  the OrderDate column.

* To find the average delivery days, a new column was created by subtracting the OrderDate from the DeliveryDate. On the PivotTable, we summarized the value field by 'Average' to get the average days of delivery.
